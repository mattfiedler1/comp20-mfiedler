This homework did not go well for me. After hours of struggling with bugs and not 
being able to figure out what could be wrong within my program I decided that I had 
to just submit it. Everything was implemented correctly until I got to the 
information windows. While working on those I got an error that niether I nor the 
TA were able to remedy. After spendinng a lot of time struggling with this and 
trying to get rid of my errors, I was forced to give up and submit. Due to the time 
constriction I was also unable to implement the part of the assignment where we are
asked to find the closest station and draw a line between the geolocator and the 
station correctly. I could not figure out why the code I wrote was not working.
To me, it looks like it should work, however I do recognize that functionality is
more important in the end. I commented out as much as I could in order to make it somewhat 
functional, but the commented code is the code I believe should have and could have worked.
